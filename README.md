# EliteChallenges

This plugin allows players to participate in daily challenges. Every day there are new challenges that arise from the configured challenges set in your config that the players compete to get the highest score in to reap the rewards.

First place, second, and third place players get rewarded in the default config, however, this can easily be changed. There are different types of challenges that you can configure, for example, challenges when a block is broken or when a block is placed, and you can configure unlimited challenges.

## Features

Challenges will appear in a GUI that can be opened by typing /challenges. This GUI will display all the available challenges up at the time.

Currently, 5 challenges can be up at one time and this cannot be changed, however, this number will be able to be changed when I add more to the config. The 5 challenges currently appear on slots 12-16.

Two challenges are clock icons not because they are the same challenge but because one is a warzone time and because another is a total playtime challenge. There will never be duplicate challenges up at the same time, this would cause issues so I've prevented this.
